# Unsupervised-Learning-Principal-Components-Analysis-and-Clustering

## Goal:
Build and evaluate K-means and hierarchical clustering models

## Data:
https://www.kaggle.com/c/Kannada-MNIST

## Steps:
1. Cross-validation
2. EDA
3. Fit a random forest classifier
4. Execute principal components analysis (PCA) 
5. Use k-means clustering to group MNIST observations into 1 of 10 categories and then assign labels
6. Conduct Design of Experiments to evaluate the performance of various neural networks by changing the layers and nodes. 
7. Tested neural network structures 
8. Fit neural network and observe trials for each cell in the design
9. Evaluate goodness of fit metrics on the training and validation sets
10. Provide a multi-class confusion matrix
